# ATMega16-Numbers-And-Leds
Save two Numbers in Program Memory and ouput in LEDS if they are odd or even

The code is written in AVR Assembly low-level language

We check which number is greater, then output in the LEDs the last 2 digits of the greater number.

After that, we check if the two numbers are odd or even, and make the corresponding LED output:

LEDs are connected in PORTB of the microcontroller
